## Example ideas for further development

- Nth caller game - like when a radio station says, the 10th caller wins free tickets.
  Interactions could be hosting a new game, and calling in.
- Lottery - people can purchase tickets and then winner(s) is selected at random to receive the pot from ticket purchases.
- Microblogging - very stripped down version of twitter.
  Interactions could be posting an update and tipping someone when you like their update.
- A sports book - interactions are offering a bet, accepting a bet, and judging an outcome (reporting who really won the sports ball game).
